                <h1>Our Story</h1>
                <p>In 2020, I started transcribing sheet music for songs that I loved the most, but didn’t have sheet music available online for them. I had been playing piano since I was in 3rd grade, and music had always been one of my favorite hobbies, but when I wasn’t learning classical repertoire, I loved to de-stress by playing my favorite pop songs and ballads on the piano. Here, I hope to build a community where we can all learn how to play our favorite songs, share recommendations with each other, and have fun!</p>

                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I’m Sammi, a junior at Carnegie Mellon University studying Business Administration and Statistics. I started playing piano in 2011, and later went on to start playing cello as well in 2014 when I started attending a performing arts middle school as an Instrumental Music student. Although I started playing music less when I entered high school, I always return to music as a hobby when I need to de-stress from academics. In particular, I loved playing pop songs, and I listen to American pop, Korean pop, Chinese pop, and Japanese soundtracks. My favorite genres are ballads and R&B.</p>
