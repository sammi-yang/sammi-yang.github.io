		<!-- In this website, I shared some of my favorite Asian eateries around CMU. One of my favorite things to do when I have free time while at school is explore the various restaurants and eateries around Pittsburgh and take advantage of the convenience and diversity of dining out in the city. In particular, I focused on Asian cuisines, as for me and my friends, we were always eager to taste new local food in the area that could remind us of home. In the website, I listed just some of my favorite places, menu recommendations, and pictures, and then provided more information about their addresses and contact information in the Directory page. I also gave a space for viewers to submit some of their own recommendations so we could mutually share our favorite places. -->

		<h1>Student-Favorite Asian Eateries Near CMU</h1>
		<h5>Published on September 11, 2023</h5>
		<h5>Author: Sammi Yang</h5>

		<div class="intro">
			Being a city that houses a lot of universities, Pittsburgh is a home away from home for many college students. Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in particular has a large Asian population, including international students, so finding restaurants that remind us of food we loved back home is important to a lot of students. Coming from an immigrant Chinese family and having a very Asian palate, I loved being able to explore restaurants around Pittsburgh and also try new types of Asian cuisine and staple recipes.
			<br>
			In this page, I've compiled a (non-exhaustive) list of Asian restaurants in Pittsburgh that I like to visit! To find the addresses, contact information, and menu for each restaurant listed, please visit the <span>Directory</span> page listed in the navigation bar at the top of this page. To submit any of your own recommendations, please visit the <span>Submit Recommendations</span> page listed in the navigation bar. Lastly, if you have any questions or concerns, visit the <span>Contact</span> page!

			<h2>1. Sichuan Gourmet</h2>
			<p>
				Sichuan Gourmet is a restaurant in Squirrel Hill dedicated to introducing authentic Sichuan cuisine, in both tradition and up-to-date style, to the area. Sichuan cuisine is a style of Chinese cuisine originating in the Sichuan Province of China, and is famed for bold flavors. The executive chef and the secondary chef are both from Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province.
				<br>
				If you love spicy food (or even if you don't), this is a great spot to visit for an extensive menu of flavorful dishes! They even have an option for hot pot, which is great for cold days or nights to share with your friends.

			<h2>2. Love Ramen (Malaxiangguo)</h2>
			<p>
				Love Ramen (also called Malaxiangguo) is a restaurant in Oakland near the University of Pittsburgh that serves malaxiangguo (spicy stir-fry hot pot) and malatang (spicy numbing hot soup). Although dishes flavored with mala are often very spicy, you can specify the level of spice when paying for your bowl.
				<br>
				What sets this place apart is that you can choose from their set menu of noodle dishes, or make your own bowl of noodles or dry pot for which you would pay by weight (the latter is more common)! The ability to customize your bowls give you more control over what you eat, making it a great option for those who may have dietary restrictions, all while enjoying the classic flavor of mala dishes.
